# FlappyNet
FlappyNet is a Python game I am currently developing using the pygame Python module.

## Installing Instructions
### Linux:
1. Open your terminal (press Ctrl+Alt+T)
2. If you haven't already, install the latest version of Python (`sudo apt-get install python3`) and install pip (`sudo apt-get install python3-pip`)
3. Install pygame (the backbone of the game) using `pip install pygame`
4. Type `git clone github.com/arandomsite/FlappyNet` into your terminal. This should copy the code from this repository and to a folder named "FlappyNet"
5. And finally, launch the game using `cd FlappyNet && python3 .`
